## Installation
To run this bot, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the necessary packages.

Ensure you have **Python 3.8** or higher installed on your system.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/skysoulkeeper/QuizBoutiqueBot.git
   cd QuizBoutiqueBot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Prepare the Configuration File:**

   ‚Ä¢ Modify the [`config.yml`](configs/config.yml) file in the `configs` directory to set up your desired settings, including the Telegram bot token, proxy settings, and localization.


2. **Run the Bot:**

   ‚Ä¢ Execute the `app.py` script to start the bot:
    ```bash
        python app.py
    ```

3. **Interact with the Bot:**

    ‚Ä¢ Use Telegram to interact with the bot by sending commands like /start to begin.

## How It Works
- **Configuration Loading:**
  - On startup, the bot loads configurations from [config.yml](configs/config.yml), including settings for logging, proxies, directories, and Telegram.

- **Initialization:**
  - Initializes directories, sets up logging, proxy settings, and loads localization files.

- **Command Handlers:**
  - Handles various commands like /start, and button presses using command handlers defined in the code.

- **Quizzes:**
  - Users can select categories and quizzes, which are loaded from JSON files in the specified directories. Questions can be randomized if enabled.

- **Timer:**
  - If the timer is enabled, users must complete the quiz within the specified time limit.

- **Question Pools:**
  - The question pools are located in the data/questions directory.

## Adding Your Own Quizzes
### Creating Quiz Files
**Format:**
- Quizzes are stored in JSON format.
- Each quiz file contains a list of question objects with the following keys:
  - question: The quiz question.
  - answers: A list of possible answers.
  - correct_answer: The correct answer to the question.
  - explanation (optional): An explanation for the correct answer.

**Example:**
```json
[
  {
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "answers": ["A. Berlin", "B. Paris", "C. Rome", "D. Madrid"],
    "correct_answer": "B. Paris",
    "explanation": "Paris is the capital and most populous city of France."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which planet is known as the Red Planet?",
    "answers": ["A. Earth", "B. Mars", "C. Jupiter", "D. Venus"],
    "correct_answer": "B. Mars",
    "explanation": "Mars is often called the 'Red Planet' because of its reddish appearance."
  }
]
```

**Organizing Quizzes**
- Categories:
  - Organize quizzes into categories by creating subdirectories within the data/questions directory.
  - Each category should contain quiz files related to that topic.
- Naming Conventions:
  - Use clear and descriptive names for quiz files and categories.
  - Quiz file names should end with .json.

**Updating the Questions Directory**

- Adding Quizzes:
  - Place your quiz JSON files into the appropriate category directory.
  - No need to restart the bot; it dynamically reads the quiz files.
- Refreshing Quizzes:
  - Ensure that the JSON files are correctly formatted to avoid errors.

## Customization
**Emojis and Icons**
- The bot uses emojis and icons for a better user experience.
- Emojis can be customized in the [config.yml](configs/config.yml) file under the emoji section.

**Example:**
```yaml
emoji:
  test: "üìù"
  timer: "‚è±Ô∏è"
  enabled: "‚úÖ"
  disabled: "‚ùå"
  back_button: "üîô"
  settings: "‚öôÔ∏è"
  help: "‚ùì"
  language: "üåê"
```

**Localization Files**

- Adding New Languages:
  - Localization files are stored in the locales directory as YAML files.
  - To add a new language, create a new YAML file with the language code, e.g., fr.yml for French.
- Translating Strings:
  - Provide translations for each key present in other localization files.
  - Ensure that all required keys are included to prevent missing text in the bot.

## Advanced Configuration
- Proxy Support

  - If you need to use a proxy:

      1.	Enable Proxy in [config.yml](configs/config.yml):
    ```yaml
    proxy_settings:
      proxy_enabled: False                              # Enable or disable proxy usage
      proxy_host: ""                                    # Proxy server IP address or hostname
      proxy_port: 1080                                  # Proxy server port number
      proxy_protocol: "socks"                           # Proxy protocol (e.g., "http", "https", "socks")
      proxy_username: ""                                # Username for proxy authentication
      proxy_password: ""                                # Password for proxy authentication
    ```

    2.	Supported Proxy Types:
    - HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5 proxies are supported.
